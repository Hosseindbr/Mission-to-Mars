# Mission-to-Mars
## Overview of the Project
The project was composed of a Python script that scraped images and text from various websites that discussed Mission to Mars. To display all the data in a central location without having to gather it manually, a Flask web application was cewated with a rendered HTML template designed using Bootstrap. A Mongo database was used to store the scraped and displayed data. In addition, the scraping script can be connected to the button clicking script so that every time a button is clicked, scraping occurs again, the database is updated, and new data is displayed. Furthermore, Bootstrap's grid system makes the application responsive on various devices.
